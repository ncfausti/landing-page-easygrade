        "content": "The image is a handwritten note about the computational complexity of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Here are the details of the contents:\n\n1. Title: \"Computational Complexity\"\n2. The transformation of the DFT is noted from Time to Frequency domain.\n3. A key formula for the DFT is given: \n   \\[\n   X(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) W_N^{kn}\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(k) \\) is the DFT at frequency index \\( k \\), \\( x(n) \\) is the time-domain signal, \\( W_N \\) is the complex nth root of unity, and \\( N \\) is the total number of points in the time domain signal.\n4. An expansion of the formula for \\( X(k) \\) is provided as a series:\n   \\[\n   X(k) = x(0)W_N^{k\\cdot0} + x(1)W_N^{k\\cdot1} + \\ldots + x(N-1)W_N^{k\\cdot(N-1)}\n   \\]\n5. It concludes with a statement about the computational effort, noting that there are \\( N \\) computations in total. This refers to the number of outputs \\( X(k) \\) computed, each possibly requiring \\( N \\) multiplications and additions, indicating an \\( O(N^2) \\) computational complexity without optimizations like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n\nThe class of algorithms like FFT that compute the DFT more efficiently than the direct calculation are not mentioned but are implicitly relevant to discussions on lowering the complexity from \\( O(N^2) \\)."
